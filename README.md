# Membership-Inference-Attacks-Mitigation
Source code for Membership Inference Attacks on Machine Learning Models: Analysis and Mitigation

It contains protects the membership attack for three different algorithms:
  1. Feed-Forward Neural Network
  2. Convolutional Neural Network
  3. Logistic Regression
  
Different methodologies like adversarial noise layer, Gaussian noise layer and exponential mechanisms were used to preserve the privacy of the machine learning models from membership inference attack.
